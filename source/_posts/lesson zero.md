Today you are going to learn how to convert 110101110010101101001001 to a decimal number. No seriously, we are.

Can you say hacker status? It’s going to be awesome. Just wait!

## **Welcome to the World of Binary!**

Yes, the computer hacker stuff you see on tv, and just to clear the record: no, programmers don’t really write code in binary nor do they stare at binary numbers all day.

In fact, they rarely need to use binary numbers. But nonetheless, they are a foundational aspect of computer science that pop up here and there and are a fun application of base systems!

Who wants to guess what base binary is?

hint: remember base refers to the number of symbols in the system.

**Two. Binary is the base two number system**. Therefore, we express it using two symbols, 0 and 1. Binary follows the same exponential pattern we discovered with the decimal system, except of course instead of powers of 10 we will use powers of 2.

For example, here is a random binary number.

I simply replaced the ten’s with two’s and we now have a binary place-value system! Of course, we no longer can refer to the place-values as ones, tens, hundreds, … because that’s decimal. We must rename them.

Let’s calculate these first five place-values to find out their names.

It may seem strange, but the place-value names for the first five binary place-values are: one’s, two’s, four’s, eight’s and sixteen’s place.

## **Example 1**

Let’s convert the above binary number 11001.

First write out a binary expansion to figure out what this number would be in decimal. Remember a “1” means we have the number in the place-value, a “0” means we do not.

The binary number 11001 means we have 1 one, 1 eight and 1 sixteen. Now add them up. Hence, 11001 = 25.

## **Example 2**

Let’s try a larger number. How about 1010101?

**Step 1:** Think about the binary place-value system.

**Step 2:** Calculate each column’s value.

**Step 3:** Add.

## **Example 3**

*Can you convert the decimal number 9 into binary?*

To solve this problem you need to think about the largest power of 2 that is less than 9. Let’s look at the binary place-value system to aid us.
![](https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*tSMlQYamBBtFdrXC5l8BZA.png)

It looks like 8 is the largest number less than 9, so place a 1 in the eight’s column.
![](https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*UFiCtK_DDKleY9QUnFehag.png)

We still need 1 more unit to make 9, so place a 1 in the one’s place-value.

Fill in the other places with zeros. We needn’t fill in any columns to the left of the eight’s column since that is the largest place-value in use.

Therefore, 9 = 1001 in binary.

### Hence the secret to life, the universe and everything else, in binary, is 101010, obviously.
